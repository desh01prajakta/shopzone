# Introduction

This is a E-Commerce Website, I would like to add some features related to filter and sort all products available on the website.
i wanted to give my target customer a very user friendly experience so that they do not have to go back and forth many times to purchase each item.

# Structure

i wanted to show all available products on home page itself, so that without logging in customer will be able to see all products.
once customer interested to know product, he/she will have to register/log in to see product price and other details.
i am going to add 'CART' in a separate tab so that customer can review their product and continue shopping if they want.
I will craete some React component separately like login page, register page, product list page, product Details page etc.
i will also create saperate CSS files for each component.
I am also going to create Navbar and connect all component to each other.
